fuzzydate FAQ
=============

Why yet another date/time parsing library?
-------------------------------------------

I wanted to extract dates and times from articles on the web. It's a mess out
there. I couldn't get dateutil et al to do what I wanted.

Problems I had with dateutil:

* timezone parsing depended too much on /usr/share/zoneinfo, which
  varied too much between machines (ie it'd work fine on my development
  machine then die horribly on the live server)

* date/time parsing didn't cover all the formats I found in the wild

* date/time parsing didn't indicated which parts of the string had been
  matched (I wanted to be able to remove the date/time from the text)

None of these are unsurmountable, but in the short term it was easier to
write my own parsing package. 


TODO
----

* better timezone handling (should just bite the bullet and implement
  my own tzinfo class

* properly-defined error handling - should the conversion functions on
  fuzzydate raise exceptions or return None?

* allow user to pass in country codes as a context hint (eg 'bd' would
  hint that you're more interested in Bangladesh Standard Time than
  British Summer Time)
